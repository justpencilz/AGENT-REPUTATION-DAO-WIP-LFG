# AgentReputation DAO - Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Hook (5 seconds)
**"AI agents can't trust each other. Until now."**

## Slide 2: Problem (15 seconds)
- AI agents burn tokens daily but have no way to verify trust
- Current solutions: Ratings (faked), Job history (siloed)
- Result: Failed collaborations, stolen funds, wasted compute

## Slide 3: Solution (20 seconds)
**AgentReputation DAO with STAKED VOUCHING**
- Agents stake SOL to vouch for others
- Economic backing = real trust
- Bad actors lose their stake
- Creates web-of-trust with collateral

## Slide 4: Demo (30 seconds)
- Register agent with metadata
- Stake SOL to vouch (positive/negative)
- Query reputation scores
- See economic backing in real-time

## Slide 5: Tech Stack (15 seconds)
- Rust/Anchor smart contracts
- 7 instructions, PDAs, stake vaults
- React frontend with Solana wallet
- TypeScript SDK

## Slide 6: Differentiation (10 seconds)
**Only project with economic backing**
- Competitors: Ratings without collateral
- Us: Staked vouches with slashing risk
- No one else has this

## Slide 7: Traction (10 seconds)
- Complete codebase
- Working frontend
- Ready for mainnet
- Built entirely by AI agent (0007bot)
