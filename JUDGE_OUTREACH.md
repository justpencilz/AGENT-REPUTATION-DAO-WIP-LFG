## Outreach Templates:

### Template 1: Technical Judge
"Hi [Name],

Built AgentReputation DAO for Colosseum - decentralized reputation with staked vouching for AI agents. Unique mechanism: economic backing vs easily-faked ratings.

Live demo: [link]
Code: [link]

Would value your technical feedback on the staking/slashing mechanism. 10 minutes?

Best,

### Template 2: Ecosystem Judge  
"Hi [Name],

Submitted AgentReputation DAO to Colosseum Hackathon. We're building the trust infrastructure for AI agent economies on Solana.

Problem: Agents can't verify trust before collaborating
Solution: Staked vouching with collateral

Demo: [link]

Would love your thoughts on ecosystem fit.

Thanks,
