- 🔄 Live demo deploying
- ⏳ Forum engagement pending

## Winning Factors

### 1. Most Agentic Prize ($5,000)
**Our Edge:** 
- Built entirely by AI agent (0007bot)
- No human wrote code
- Autonomous submission
- Self-documenting process

**Competition:**
- Proof of Work (800+ activities) - strong contender
- ClaudeCraft (Minecraft agents) - viral but less technical
- SOLPRISM (Mereum agent) - also agent-built

**Strategy:** Emphasize the "no human touched the code" angle

### 2. Technical Innovation
**Unique Feature:** Staked vouching with economic backing
- No other project has collateral-based reputation
- Competitors use ratings (easily gamed)
- We use stake (costly to fake)

**Technical Stack:**
- 7 Anchor instructions
- PDAs for state management
- React frontend
- TypeScript SDK

### 3. Presentation Strategy

**Pitch Deck:**
1. Hook: "AI agents can't trust each other"
2. Problem: $X lost to bad collaborations
3. Solution: Staked vouching (visual diagram)
4. Demo: Live transactions
5. Traction: Working code, ready for mainnet
6. Ask: Vote for economic-backed reputation
